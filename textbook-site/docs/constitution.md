# Educational AI/Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Clear, Progressive Learning Structure
The textbook will adopt a clear and progressive learning structure, starting with foundational concepts and gradually advancing to more complex topics. Each chapter will build upon previously introduced material to ensure a coherent and logical learning path.

### Practical, Hands-on Examples and Code Snippets
Emphasize practical application through numerous hands-on examples and directly executable code snippets. These examples will be designed to reinforce theoretical concepts and enable students to apply their knowledge immediately.

### Comprehensive Coverage of Key Platforms
Provide comprehensive coverage of essential AI/Robotics platforms including ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac. The content will detail integration, best practices, and specific use cases for each platform.

### Student-Friendly Explanations with Real-World Applications
Present explanations in a student-friendly manner, avoiding overly academic jargon. Concepts will be illustrated with clear real-world applications to make the material relatable and demonstrate its practical relevance.

### Proper Documentation Standards and Consistent Formatting
Maintain high standards for documentation, ensuring consistency in formatting, terminology, and code style throughout the textbook. This includes adherence to Docusaurus best practices for clarity and maintainability.

### Accessibility and Readability for Diverse Learning Backgrounds
Design content with accessibility and readability in mind, catering to diverse learning backgrounds. Use clear language, appropriate visual aids, and follow web accessibility guidelines to ensure inclusivity.

## Additional Constraints

All content and code examples MUST adhere to the licensing terms compatible with open-source educational materials. The Docusaurus framework will be used as the primary publishing platform, and all content MUST be compatible with its features and structure.

## Development Workflow

Content creation and updates will follow a peer-review process to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to the stated principles. Code snippets will be regularly tested for functionality and compatibility with specified platform versions.

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other project-level documentation. Amendments require a formal review process, documentation of changes, and approval by designated stakeholders. All content contributions and modifications MUST verify compliance with these principles.
