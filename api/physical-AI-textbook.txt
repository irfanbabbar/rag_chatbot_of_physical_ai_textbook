Hackathon I: Create a Textbook for Teaching 
Physical Al & Humanoid Robotics Course 
The future of work will be a partnersnip between 
robots. 
people, 
intelligent 
agents 
(Al 
sofware), 
and 
This shift won't necessarily climinate jobs but will change what humans do, leading to 
amassive demand for new skills. We Fave already written a book on Al agents. Therefore, 
we wanl you (c wrile a textbook to leach a course in Physical Al & Humanoid Robolics (Te 
course details are documented below). 
Excel in the Hackathon and Launch Your Journey as an 
Al 
Startup Founder # 
We've recertly launched Panaversity (panaversity.org), an initiative focused on teaching 
cutting-ecge Al courses. Alongside this, we're working on publishing our first book, which 
you can explore al 
ai-native,panaversity.org. Our riexl milestone is lo build a portal where 
authors can create Al-native technical textbooks, and readers can easily access and learn 
from them using Al Agents. We also plan to publish O/A Level, Science, Engineering, and 
Medical Al-native books to support students and professionals across disciplines. If you 
perform well in this hackathon, you may be invited for an interview to join the Panaversity 
core team end potentially step into the role of a startup founder within this growing 
ecosystem. You will get a chance to work with Panavorsity founders Zia, Rehan, Junaid, and 
Wania and become the very best. You may also get a chance to teach at Panaversity, PIAIC, 
and GIAIC.

Why Physical Al Matters 
Humanoid robots are poised te excel in our human-centered world because they 
shave 
our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting i in 
human environments. This represents a significant transition from Al mi 
confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that oparates in sohysical 
space.

Capstone: Simulated humanoid robot with conversational Al 
Hardware Requirements 
This course is technically demanding. It sits at the intersection of three heavy 
computational loads: Physics Simulation (Isaac Sim/Gazeho), Visual Perception 
(SLAM/Computer Vision), and Generative Al (LLMsiVLAj 
Because the capstone involves a "Simulated Humanoid," 
the 
primary investment 
must be in High-Performance Workstations. However, to fulfil the "Physicel Al" 
promise, you also need Edge Computing Kits (brains without bodies) or speciic 
robot hardware. 
1, 
The “Digital Twin" Workstation (Required per Student) 
This is the most crtical component. NVIDIA Isaac Sim is an Omniverse apolication 
that requires "RTX' (Ray Tracing) capabilities. Standard laptops (MacBooks or 
non-RTX Windows machines) will not work. 
© 
* 
GPU (The Bottleneck): NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM) or higher. 
Why: Youneed high VRAN to load the USD (Universal Scene 
Description) assets for the robot and environment, plus run the VLA 
(Vsion-Language-Acton) madels simultaneously. 
© 
Ideal: RTX 3090 or 4090 (24GB VRAM) allows for smoother 
"Sim-to-Real" training, 
CPU: Into Coroi7 (13th Ger-+) or AMD Ryzon 9

* 
2. 
RAM: 64 GB DDRS (32 GB is the absolute minimum, but will crash during 
camplex scene rendering) 
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. 
Note: While Isaac Sim runs on Windows, ROS 2 (Humble/Iron) is 
native to Linux. Dual-booting or dedicatec Linux machines are 
mandatory for a friction-free experience 
The "Physical Al" Edge Kit 
Since a full humanoid robot is expensive, students learn "Physical Al" by satting uo 
the nervous system on a desk before deploying it to a robot. This kit covers Module 3 
(Isaac ROS) and Module 4 (VLA). 
+ 
The Brain: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (8GB) or Orin NX (16GB). 
Role: 
This is the incustry standard for emoodied Al. Students will 
doploy their ROS 2 nodes nore to understand resource constraints vs. 
© 
Role: 
Provides RGB (Color) and Depth (Distance) dala. Essential for 
the VSLAM and Perception modules. 
The Inner Ear (Balance): Genaric USB IMU (BNCOS5) (Often built into the 
RealSense D436i or Jetson boards, but a separate module helps teacn IMU 
calibration). 
* 
3. 
Voice Interface: A simple USB Microphone/Speaker array (e.0., ReSpeaker) 
for the "Voice-to-Action” Whisper integration. 
The Robot Lab 
For the "Physical" part of the course, you have three tiers of options depending on 
budget. 
Option A: The "Proxy" Approach [Recommended for Budget) 
Use a quadruped (dog) or a robotic arm as a proxy. The software principles (ROS 2, 
VSLAM, Isaac Sim) transfer 90% effectively to humanoids. 
Robot: 
Unitree Go2 Edu (~$1.800 - $3,000). 
Pros: Highly durable, excellent ROS 2 support, affordable enough to have 
multiple units. 
© 
Cons: Not a biped (humanoid). 
Option B: The "Miniature Humanoid" Approach 
‘Small, table-top humanoids. 
* 
* 
Robot: 
or 
Unitree H1 is too expensive ($90k+), so look at Unitree G1 (~$16k) 
Robotis OP3 (alder, but stable, ~$12k) 
Budget Alternative: Hiwonder TonyPi Pro (~$600) 
© 
Warning: The cheap kils (Hiwonder) usually run on Raspberty Pi, 
which cannot run NVIDIA |saac ROS efficiently. You would use these 
only for kinematics (walking) and use the Jetson kits for Al 
Option C: The "Premium" Lab (Sim-to-Real specific) 
Ifthe goal is to actually deploy the Capstone to a real humanoid: 
* 
4, 
Robot: 
Unitree G1 Humanoid. 
Why: Itis one of the few commercially available humancids that can 
actually walk dynamically and has an SDK open enough for students to 
inject their own ROS 2 controllers.

Ifyou do not have access to RTX-enabled workstations, we must restructure the 
course to rely entiroly on cloud-based instances (like AWS RoboMaker or NVIDIA's 
cloud delivery for Omniverse), though ths introduces significant latency and cost 
complexity.
