## Prompt


## Response snapshot

The implementation tasks for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" feature (branch `001-ai-robotics-textbook`) have been generated and saved to `/home/aza_comp/physical-ai-textbook/specs/001-ai-robotics-textbook/tasks.md`. The summary includes total tasks, tasks per user story, parallel opportunities, independent test criteria, and suggested MVP scope. The `tasks.md` file provides a detailed, ordered list of implementation steps. You can now proceed to implement these tasks using the `/sp.implement` command.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Implementation tasks generated and organized.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: `specs/001-ai-robotics-textbook/tasks.md` created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to proceed with implementation (`/sp.implement`).
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully generated a comprehensive set of tasks based on the specification and plan, adhering to the required format and organization by user story. The tasks are detailed and ready for implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
